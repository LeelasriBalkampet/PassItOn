            <h4> At PassItOn </h4>
            <p>we are on a mission to transform the way we view and handle surplus resources. Every year, tons of food and other essentials go to waste while countless individuals face scarcity. We're here to bridge that gap, fostering a culture of sharing and sustainability.

                    We started with a simple question: What if surplus could create value instead of waste? This idea grew into a platform where individuals, businesses, and communities unite to share resources, reduce waste, and spread kindness.
                    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
                    <p>We are more than a platform; we are a movement toward conscious living. Our team comprises dedicated individuals, passionate volunteers, and innovative thinkers who believe in the power of collaboration. Together, we work to minimize food wastage, support the needy, and promote mindful consumption habits.</p>
                    <p>We understand that small actions lead to big changes. By creating a seamless way for people and businesses to share what they don't need, we're making sustainable living accessible to everyone.</p>
                    <h2>What Drives Us</h2>
                    <h3>Reducing Waste</h3>
                    <p>Globally, food waste is a massive challenge. Perfectly edible food ends up in landfills while many go hungry. By redistributing leftover food and surplus items, we turn waste into opportunity.</p>
                    <h3>Supporting Communities</h3>
                    <p>Whether it's a meal from a nearby restaurant or leftover furniture from a neighbor, our platform ensures these resources benefit people who truly need them.</p>
                    <h3>Encouraging Resourcefulness</h3>
                    <p>We provide innovative ideas and tools, like leftover recipe suggestions, to help users make the most out of what they already have.</p>
                    <h3>Sustainability at Heart</h3>
                    <p>Waste reduction is not just about foodâ€”it's about fostering habits that lead to a healthier planet. From sharing non-food essentials like clothing and books to promoting discounts on near-expiry items, we strive to reduce what gets discarded.</p>
                    <h2>What We Offer</h2>
                    <h3>Food Redistribution</h3>
                    <p>Collecting surplus from hotels, restaurants, and events to provide meals to those in need.</p>
                    <p>Allowing individuals to share leftover food in their communities.</p>
                    <h3>Community Connection</h3>
                    <p>Creating a network of neighbors and local businesses to share and exchange surplus food, books, furniture, and more.</p>
                    <p>Enabling users to connect directly for seamless resource sharing.</p>
                    <h3>Smart Consumption</h3>

                    <p>Volunteers and businesses work hand-in-hand to deliver unsold food or essentials to those in need.</p>
